# Hamurger Menu

Source for this: [Andy Bell's Fully-responsive, progressively enhanced burger menu](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/build-a-fully-responsive-progressively-enhanced-burger-menu/)

## Things I am learning:
Navigations need to have aria-labels on them to assist with screen readers (especially if there is more than one navigation element used).

I learned about what a skip link is and how this works with focusing and tabbing; also tabIndex -1 and how that works (????)
