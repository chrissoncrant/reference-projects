## Things I am learning:
Navigations need to have aria-labels on them to assist with screen readers (especially if there is more than one navigation element used).

I learned about what a skip link is and how this works with focusing and tabbing; also tabIndex -1 and how that works (????)

Using aria-label="Home Page" for link elements that wrap the header image logo.

Adding aria-label="primary" to the nav element in the site header

Adding role="list" to the unordered list that has its default styling removed.

Utilizing the flow class utility for easily, and consistently adding space
