# Styling the Select Element

This is a useful way to style elements. It allows for the functionality of the select element that is already pre-built into the HTML element and thus reliable across browsers, while also allowing for custom styling that will also be reliable across browsers. 

The styling of select elements is notoriously difficult, but this method bypasses this difficulty. 

This component consists of 4 elements:
- wrapper element
- select element
- div element that is used for the presentation.
- pseudo-element for the down chevron symbol.
    - This element can be an icon of some sort; there would be benefits of using an icon instead of using a pseudo-element, but this chevron is styled completely with CSS.

See style.css for notes on the functionality for the rules declarations.

The JavaScript is very straight forward.
